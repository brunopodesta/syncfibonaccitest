# SyncVR Mobile Developer Assestment 

The project is designed in 3 layers: data,
domain and presentation
- In the Data layer is the database, I use Room for the
storage of the numbers that the user received. There is a class
FibonacciEntity that represents the table, containing: id autogenerated id field to identify the register, number, is the fibonacci number and saveTime the time in which that number was obtained
The FibonacciDao class in which the operations of the database are defined: register a number, get the complete list of previous numbers and remove all records.
FibonacciProvider is the class that returns a random number of the first 30 numbers of the fibonacci sequence
FibonacciRepository is the class that is responsible for interacting with the database and the class to provide the numbers

- Domain Layer: it is where the use cases are defined for the different actions performed in the Data layer, then supplied to the presentation layer. The Fibonacci class is defined in
the one that contains the data of the number and the data of the time


- Presentation Layer: following the MVVM pattern we have the classes:
  * MainActivity: class in which the data and different views with which the user interacts are presented
  * FibonacciModelView: ViewModel in which the LiveData that our view will use to display the data is defined
and where the coroutines for obtaining data are also executed
  * FibonacciAdpater: Adapter to display the list of records of the numbers that the user was obtaining

For this project Dagger Hilt was used for dependency injection.
